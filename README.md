# Predify

Predify is a permissionless binary prediction market for DeFi.

Creators can create prediction markets using inbuilt resolution strategies, users can participate by simply betting on the outcome and developers can build custom onchain or offchain resolution strategies to resolve the outcome of prediction.

Some example markets could be:

1.  Will a governance vote pass in a certain protocol?
2.  Will a protocol reach a certain TVL in terms of number of ETH or number of tokens in 2 days?
3.  Will a protocol be exploited in the next 7 days?
4.  Will the number of tokens staked in a protocol increase by 5 million in the next 10 days?
5.  Will the total number of tokens issued by the protocol increase to a certain value in the next 30 days?

Some protocols use data that is directly on chain to determine the outcome of prediction, while others must use off-chain data sources.

The protocol tracks the outcome of predictions based on the configured strategy at the time of creation of market, and rewards users who bet on the correct outcome.
